# Hospital Admission Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project analyzes hospital admissions across Saudi hospitals from 2020 to 2024 using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into seasonal trends, readmission rates, emergency visits, and the impact of comorbid conditions on patient stays.

## Problem Statement

Hospitals need a data-driven approach to optimize resource allocation, improve patient outcomes, and identify key admission trends, including seasonal peaks, readmission causes, and emergency visit severity.

## Approach

Data collection and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Metrics calculation (readmission rates, emergency visit percentage, length of stay)
Dashboard development in Power BI
## Key Insights

Peak admission seasons and time-based trends
Common conditions leading to hospital visits
Readmission trends by severity and condition type
Emergency visit frequency and severity distribution
Relationship between comorbid conditions and hospital stays
## Tools & Technologies

Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization
DAX – Custom calculations and measures
Python – Data preprocessing
## Usage

Open the Power BI dashboard file (.pbix).
Interact with filters to analyze different timeframes, conditions, and patient demographics.
Use insights for hospital resource planning and decision-making.
## Future Enhancements

Integrate real-time data updates
Predictive analysis for admission forecasting
Advanced segmentation by patient history and outcomes
